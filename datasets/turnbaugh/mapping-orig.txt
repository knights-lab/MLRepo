Community DNA was prepared and used for pyrosequencing (454 Life Sciences), as well as for PCR and sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Shotgun reads were mapped to reference genomes using the National Center for Biotechnology Information ?non-redundant? database, KEGG17, STRING18, CAZy (http://www.cazy.org/) and a 44-member human-gut microbial genome database.

De-identified samples were stored at -80_?C before processing. Ten to twenty grams of each sample was pulverized in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. An aliquot (approximately 500_mg) of each sample was then suspended, while frozen, in a solution containing 500__l of extraction buffer (200_mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200_mM NaCl, 20_mM EDTA), 210__l of 20% SDS, 500__l of a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 7.9), and 500__l of a slurry of 0.1-mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Microbial cells were subsequently lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2_min at room temperature, followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol. DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology. Finally, human sequences were removed by identifying sequences homologous to the Homo sapiens reference genome (BLASTN E_<_10-5, %identity_>_75, score_>_50).	64	CGS-GL	V2	256.0508423	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Obese	37.09024	27	Mom	0	CGS-GL	The gut microbiome of obese and lean monozygotic and dizygotic twins

DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology.

Microbial cells were subsequently lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2_min at room temperature, followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol. DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology. Finally, human sequences were removed by identifying sequences homologous to the Homo sapiens reference genome (BLASTN E_<_10-5, %identity_>_75, score_>_50).	23	CGS-GL	V2	256.0508423	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Lean	37.09024	128	Twin	0	CGS-GL	The gut microbiome of obese and lean monozygotic and dizygotic twins

DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA.

Microbial cells were subsequently lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2_min at room temperature, followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol. DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology. Finally, human sequences were removed by identifying sequences homologous to the Homo sapiens reference genome (BLASTN E_<_10-5, %identity_>_75, score_>_50).	51	CGS-GL	V2	256.0508423	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Lean	37.09024	2	Twin	0	CGS-GL	The gut microbiome of obese and lean monozygotic and dizygotic twins

DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).

Microbial cells were subsequently lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2_min at room temperature, followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol. DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology. Finally, human sequences were removed by identifying sequences homologous to the Homo sapiens reference genome (BLASTN E_<_10-5, %identity_>_75, score_>_50).	25	CGS-GL	V2	256.0508423	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Overweight	37.09024	3	Mom	0	CGS-GL	The gut microbiome of obese and lean monozygotic and dizygotic twins

DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology.

DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology.

An aliquot (approximately 500_mg) of each sample was then suspended, while frozen, in a solution containing 500__l of extraction buffer (200_mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200_mM NaCl, 20_mM EDTA), 210__l of 20% SDS, 500__l of a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 7.9), and 500__l of a slurry of 0.1-mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Microbial cells were subsequently lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2_min at room temperature, followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol. DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology.

Microbial cells were subsequently lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2_min at room temperature, followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol. DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology. Finally, human sequences were removed by identifying sequences homologous to the Homo sapiens reference genome (BLASTN E_<_10-5, %identity_>_75, score_>_50).	53	CGS-GL	V2	256.0508423	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Lean	37.09024	4	Twin	0	CGS-GL	The gut microbiome of obese and lean monozygotic and dizygotic twins

An aliquot (approximately 500_mg) of each sample was then suspended, while frozen, in a solution containing 500__l of extraction buffer (200_mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200_mM NaCl, 20_mM EDTA), 210__l of 20% SDS, 500__l of a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 7.9), and 500__l of a slurry of 0.1-mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Microbial cells were subsequently lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2_min at room temperature, followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol. DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology. Finally, human sequences were removed by identifying sequences homologous to the Homo sapiens reference genome (BLASTN E_<_10-5, %identity_>_75, score_>_50).	51	CGS-GL	V2	256.0508423	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Obese	37.09024	61	Twin	0	CGS-GL	The gut microbiome of obese and lean monozygotic and dizygotic twins

DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology.

DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology.

DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology. Finally, human sequences were removed by identifying sequences homologous to the Homo sapiens reference genome (BLASTN E_<_10-5, %identity_>_75, score_>_50).	52	CGS-GL	V2	256.0508423	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Obese	37.09024	83	Twin	0	CGS-GL	The gut microbiome of obese and lean monozygotic and dizygotic twins

Metabolic reconstructions were performed based on CAZy, KEGG and STRING annotations. The relative abundance of KEGG metabolic pathways is referred to as a ?metabolic profile?.	human gut metagenome	408170	UBERON:feces	TS162.2	TS162.2	-95.712891	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	3/1/2007-8/31/2008	Faecal samples were frozen immediately after they were produced. De-identified samples were stored at -80_?C before processing. Ten to twenty grams of each sample was pulverized in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. An aliquot (approximately 500_mg) of each sample was then suspended, while frozen, in a solution containing 500__l of extraction buffer (200_mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200_mM NaCl, 20_mM EDTA), 210__l of 20% SDS, 500__l of a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 7.9), and 500__l of a slurry of 0.1-mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Microbial cells were subsequently lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2_min at room temperature, followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol. DNA obtained from three separate aliquots of each faecal sample were pooled (_200__g DNA) and used for pyrosequencing (see below). Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on the 454 FLX pyrosequencer from total faecal community DNA. Two samples were also analysed in a single run using Titanium extra-long-read pyrosequencing technology (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sequencing reads with degenerate bases (?Ns?) were removed along with all duplicate sequences, as sequences of identical length and content are a common artefact of the pyrosequencing methodology. Finally, human sequences were removed by identifying sequences homologous to the Homo sapiens reference genome (BLASTN E_<_10-5, %identity_>_75, score_>_50).	30	CGS-GL	V2	256.0508423	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Obese	37.09024	162	Mom	0	CGS-GL	The gut microbiome of obese and lean monozygotic and dizygotic twins
